# Coherence Kernel: The Universal Stability Guardrail
**Powered by the Universal Emergence Dynamics Protocol (UEDP)**

The **Coherence Kernel** is a proprietary stability framework designed for autonomous agentic streams. It implements the mathematical rigors of the UEDP to monitor systemic integrity and prevent agentic collapse.

## 🛡️ The 1/e Critical Threshold
This kernel operationalizes the **Optimal Stopping Principle**. 
* **The Law**: Every complex system has a critical coherence boundary at $\Omega \approx 0.368$ ($1/e$).
* **The Protection**: When the **Sequential Instability Index ($I_{seq}$)** suggests a breach of this threshold, the kernel triggers a safe-state transition.

## ⚖️ Intellectual Property Notice
Usage is governed by the **Hidden Pointz EULA**. The application of the $1/e$ constant as an emergence guardrail is a protected trade secret. Reverse engineering of the $I_{seq}$ weighting algorithms is strictly prohibited.
